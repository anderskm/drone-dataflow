% SUBPIX2D   Sub-pixel locations in 2D image
%
% Usage:    [rs, cs] = subpix2d(r, c, L);
%
% Arguments:
%         r, c - row, col vectors of extrema to pixel precision.
%            L - 2D corner image
%
% Returns:
%       rs, cs - row, col vectors of valid extrema to sub-pixel
%                precision.
%
% Note that the number of sub-pixel extrema returned can be less than the number
% of integer precision extrema supplied.  Any computed sub-pixel location that
% is more than 0.5 pixels from the initial integer location is rejected.  The
% reasoning is that this implies that the extrema should be centred on a
% neighbouring pixel, but this is inconsistent with the assumption that the
% input data represents extrema locations to pixel precision.
%
% The sub-pixel locations are solved by forming a Taylor series representation
% of the corner image values in the vicinity of each integer location extrema
%
%   L(x) = L + dL/dx' x + 1/2 x' d2L/dx2 x
%
% x represents a position relative to the integer location of the extrema.  This
% gives us a quadratic and we solve for the location where the gradient is zero
% - these are the extrema locations to sub-pixel precision

% ** I am not entirely satisfied with the output of this function. Perhaps using
% finite differences for derivative calculation is a problem, try using Farid
% and Simoncelli's approach? **
